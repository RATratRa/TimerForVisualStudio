# Timer for VisualStudio

My goal was to create a way to track how much time I spend at work. This program is designed for that. Every time I start Visual Studio, a timer turns on, which, when the program is turned off, 
will write all the data to a txt file and display the time as a notification on Windows. And after restarting, the program will take this data and add it. 
As a result, we have a message about the current time spent at work and the global time I spent. It looks like this:

This program can be used not only for VisualStudio, but also for others.

I am also plan to complete:
  1. Interface.
  2. The possibility of saving a file with data in the cloud.
  3. Data encryption
